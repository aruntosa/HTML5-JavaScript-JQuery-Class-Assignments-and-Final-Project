These tips are taken from the August 2012 issue of MaximumPC magazine(pages 24-33)

   <div id="col_one"><p><span style="color:green; font-size: 15pt"><span style = "font-size: 25pt">26</span> SPOT HIDDEN WINDOWS</span><br>
Sometimes programs display a message asking
you to do something, but that message is
under another window and you don't see it.
You're waiting for the program, its waiting
for you, so nothing happens. The window is
made visible after 200 seconds but you can
shorten the delay. Launch regedit from the
Start menu, go to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\<br>
Control Panel \Desktop, double-click
ForegroundLockTimeout and select
Decimal. Change the value to 30,000
miliseconds(30 seconds).</p>

<p><span style="color:green; font-size: 15pt"><span style = "font-size: 25pt">27</span> SAVE A REGISTRY KEY</span><br>
Sometimes a change to a registry key does
not go as planed. It's quick and easy to return
to the key you changed if you've saved it to
Regedit's editing window. Click Add to
Favorites, give it a descriptive name, and
tweak away knowing that changes can be
undone in seconds.</p>
<p><span style="color:green; font-size: 15pt"><span style = "font-size: 25pt">41</span> SOLVE SLOW STARTS</span><br>
If Windows 7 is taking a long time to launch,
or shut down, the Event Viewer may tell you
which program or driver is responsible.
Click Start, type Eventvwr.msc, and press
Return. Expand the Applications and
Services Logs section and browse to the
Microsoft\Windows\Diagnostic<br>
Performance\Operational. Scroll the event
list on your PC to see if Windows knows
who to blame for your performance issues.</p></div> 

   <div id="col_two"><p><span style="color:green; font-size: 15pt"><span style = "font-size: 25pt">45</span> RESTORE RUN</span><br>
If you miss the Windows XP Run option
which was used by many to launch programs
quickly, right-click the Start orb, select
Properties->Customize, check the Run
Command box,click OK and a Run option
should now appear on the Start menu.</p>
<p><span style="color:green; font-size: 15pt"><span style = "font-size: 25pt">46</span> LAUNCH APPLETS FAST</span><br>
Don't waste time browsing to the Control
Panel for the right tool for making changes
to your computer when you can launch it
directly. To run Device Manager, for
example, click Start, type Device in the
search box and Windows should display a
Device manager link for you. Windows also
responds to vague searches, so if you type
partition, the disk management tool will be
listed.</p>
<p><span style="color:green; font-size: 15pt"><span style = "font-size: 25pt">72</span> SPEED UP SEARCHES</span><br>
Right-click the Start button and select
Properties. Click Customize, scroll down the
list of available options and select "Search
without public folders" under "Search other
files and libraries". Click OK and results
should appear much quicker than before, as
there are far fewer places to search. Public
folders are rarely used by most people so
axing them in search is a cost-free speed up
trick. which was used by many to launch
programs quickly, right-click the Start orb,
select Properties->Customize, check the Run
Command box,click OK and a Run option
should now appear on the Start menu.</p></div>
