<h1 align="center">Specifics about the field</h1>
<p>The number of computer programmers nationwide should expand by about 12% between 2010 and 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Thatâ€™s close to the average growth rate for all occupations.
<p>Job growth for computer programmers in the United States will be somewhat limited by the fact that programming can be done from anywhere, meaning companies have outsourced some jobs to other countries. However, the continuing growth of the computer software business should translate into enough jobs for both overseas and American workers, according to the BLS.</p>
<p>Computer programmers made an average median salary of more than $71,000 in 2010, according to BLS figures. The top 10% made more than $114,180.</p>
<p>Career and salary potential will vary based on numerous factors, including geographic location, experience level and educational qualifications.</p></p>
