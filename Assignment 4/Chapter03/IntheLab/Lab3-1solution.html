		<h1><i>Help the Earth - Recycle</i></h1>
		
		<p>It is time for out annual recycling drive! Recycling means taking a product or material at the end of its useful life and making it as a usable raw mateiral
		to make another product. We have been very successful with plastic and paper products. Last year, we recycled more products than the previous three years. Let's
		try to do it again this year. We will have a dinner for everyone involved with the recycle drive on Saturday night. We hope to see you all there.

		<h2>About Recycling</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:20px">
			Reduce, reuse, recycle (also known as R3) is a widely accepted waste management method designed to reduce the 
			total use of environmental resources and lessen humans' carbon footprint on earth.  
			Reducing involves limiting purchases and accummulation; consequently reducing the amount of waste produced. Reduction strategies include buying used products; 
			avoiding disposable products; renting or borrowing in place of new purchases; and phasing print mail out of your life.
			Reusing products makes both environmental and economical sense. Reusing strategies include buying used goods, reusing products such as bags 
			for the same purpose, repairing broken products instead of buying new ones and borrowing or sharing infrequently used items such as decorations.
			Recycling refers to processing, treating or converting an object into reusable materials. Commercial products made from recyclable or recycled materials 
			almost always contain a symbol on their packaging. Buy these products instead of conventional ones. You can also practice recycling by collecting 
			recyclable materials such as old electronics in your house and dropping them off at a collection center.
			
			<h3>Recycling and Environmental Facts</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In the past 50 years, humans have consumed more resources than in all previous history. U.S. EPA, 2009. Sustainable Materials Management: The Road Ahead.</li>
				<li>The way we produce, consume and dispose of our products and our food accounts for 42% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. EPA, 2009. Opportunities to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions through Materials and Land Management Practices.</li>
				<li>Between 1950 and 2005, worldwide metals production grew sixfold, oil consumption eightfold, and natural gas consumption 14-fold. In total, 60 billion tons of resources are now extracted annually—about 50% more than just 30 years ago. Today the average European uses 43 kilograms of resources daily, and the average American uses 88 kilograms. Worldwatch Institute, 2010. State of the World 2010.</li>
				<li>Between 1970 and 1995, the U.S. represented about one-third of the world’s total material consumption. With less than 5% of the world’s population, the U.S. consumes 33% of paper, 25% of oil, 15% of coal, 17% of aluminum, and 15% of copper. U.S. EPA, 2009. Sustainable Materials Management: The Road Ahead.</li>
				<li>Nearly three quarters of what we throw away is products, with organic materials (food and yard waste) make up the remaining 25%. EPA, 2009. Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling and Disposal in the United States: Facts and Figures for 2008.</li>
				<li>More than 100 billion pieces of junk mail are delivered in the United States each year, which comes out to 848 pieces per household. The production, distribution and disposal of all that junk mail creates over 51 million metric tons of greenhouses gases annually, the equivalent emissions of more than 9.3 million cars. ForestEthics, 2008. Climate Change Enclosed: Junk Mail’s Impact on Global Warming.</li>
				<li>The U.S. buried or burned more than 166 million tons of resources—paper, plastic, metals, glass and organic materials—in landfills and incinerators in 2008. We recycled and composted only one-third of our discards. U.S. EPA, 2009. Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States, Detailed Tables and Figures for 2008.</li>
				<li>An estimated 144 billion beverage containers were landfilled, incinerated or littered in the United States in 2005, approximately two out of every three containers sold. This amounts to 54 billion aluminum cans, 52 billion plastic bottles and jugs, 30 billion glass bottles, and about 10 billion pouches, cartons, and drink boxes. Container Recycling Institute, 2007. Water, Water Everywhere: The growth of non-carbonated beverage containers in the United States.</li>
				<li>Recycling, reuse and remanufacturing account for 3.1 million jobs in the U.S.—one out of every three green jobs. American Solar Energy Society, 2008. Defining, Estimating, and Forecasting the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Industries in the U.S and in Colorado.</li>
				<li>Making copy paper from 100% recycled content fiber instead of 100% virgin forest fibers reduces total energy consumption by 44%, net greenhouse gas emissions by 38%, particulate emissions by 41%, wastewater by 50%, solid waste by 49% and wood use by 100%. Environmental Paper Network, 2007. State of the Paper Industry.</li>
				<li>Between 1990 and 2000, Americans wasted a total of 7.1 million tons of cans, enough to manufacture 316,000 Boeing 737 airplanes or enough to reproduce the world’s entire commercial airfleet 25 times. Since the first Earth Day in 1970, Americans have thrown away 910 billion cans worth over $25 billion in current dollars. Container Recycling Institute, 2002. Trashed Cans: The Global Environmental Impacts of Aluminum Can Wasting in America.</li>
