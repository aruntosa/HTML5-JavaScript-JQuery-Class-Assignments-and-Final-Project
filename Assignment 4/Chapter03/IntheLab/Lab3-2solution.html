<p><span style="color: 19212d; font-weight: bold">Take a hike</span> along the icicle creek and watch the majestic waters flow. Enjoy the soothing sounds of the rushing waters while standing amidst the surrounding trees. This
hike is rated a double-boot because the climbing is moderately strenuous. however the land immediately around the creek is flat and allows for frequent rest stops.</p>
<p>There are so many hikes to choose from. Visit our website or stop by one of our offices to learn about other exciting hikes. We can design a hike to meet your needs or the desires of your group.</p>
